Evaluate...or naw.  A game that tests your ability to evaluate Clojure forms, written in ClojureScript.

Not all levels are complete, but the latest build is pushed [here](http://eon.mikejanger.net).

## Why?

- To build something other than the single-model CRUD web app I seem to churn out.
- To learn [ClojureScript](http://clojurescript.org/) and [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io).

## Testing

Testing requires [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).
